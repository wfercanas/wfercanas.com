👋🏻 Hi! Sorry for not posting for a long time.

The last time I tried to post something for you, the weight of my writing made me desist.

I know, it's my fault. I tend to be way too academic or dense around the kind of things I like to talk about with you.

This time I'll be here posting just for you my friend. I used to think that these words were going to be read by a lot of people and that caused the tone to change, but I promise to keep that delusion apart from now on.

I'll come here regularly to tell you all the amazing things I've been learning lately 😄.

I hope you feel comfy in this new space I set up for us. This ride will be amazing!

See you soon!
